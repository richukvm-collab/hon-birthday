<h2>Dear Hon 💖</h2>

<p>
From the moment you came into my life, everything changed.  
Your smile, your voice, your love – they make my days brighter.

You are my safe place,  
my happiness,  
my favorite person in the world.

No matter what happens,  
I will always be here for you, Hon 💕

I love you more than words can ever say.
