  <h1>POV: It’s My Love Anna’s Birthday ❤️</h1>

  <p>
    Today is not just another day on the calendar. Today is the day the most beautiful soul
    entered this world. The day that gave life to the person who changed my world forever.
    Every smile you give, every laugh you share, and every moment we spend together makes my
    life brighter and more meaningful.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are my comfort on hard days, my happiness on ordinary days, and my greatest blessing
    every single day. This little website is just a small way of showing you how much you mean
    to me. Even though words will never be enough, I want you to know that you are deeply loved,
    endlessly cherished, and forever special to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Happy Birthday, my love. May your day be filled with smiles, love, laughter, and beautiful
    memories — just like the joy you bring into my life.

      one look at you makes everything better. You have this magical way of making my heart feel
      safe and happy at the same time.
